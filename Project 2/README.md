This was my Project 2 for CS 101. 

Grade: 100%

This project was to:

Given two files (both being strings or both being ints):
Acquire the counts of the files

Allocate space for the arrays of these values

Read and store the data of these files into their appropriate arrays

Call merge sort on the arrays

Print the shared values between the arrays

We had not been taught templates yet and were not supposed to use vectors.
I used a vector on Project 1 because I found out late that we were not supposed to use them.
